# Jobs

Simple job-runner with features:

* Max simultaneous threads, but also max-per-tag
* Tasks dependent on specific other tasks being complete
* Tasks dependent on all tagged tasks being complete
* Wait for a specific task to complete

## Execution queue

* All else being equal, tasks are started in the order they were enqueued.
* Tasks will not start based on:
    * max running tasks per tag
    * dependency on specific other tasks
    * dependency on all tasks tagged by a given set of tags
* Tasks that have to wait maintain their position in the queue.
* Any error stops kicking off new tasks, allows existing tasks to complete, and the error is available.
